# TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide

This repository contains code examples and exercises from the [TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/) course on Udemy. It serves as a personal learning journal and reference for TypeScript concepts and features.

## 🚀 Features Covered So Far

### Type Annotations

- Primitive types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- Special types: `null` and `undefined`
- Arrays and objects
- Functions and parameters
- Type inference and when to use explicit annotations

### Type Definitions

- Built-in objects (like `Date`)
- Object literals with specific shapes
- Union types
- Type annotations for function return values

### Type Inference

- TypeScript's ability to infer types
- When type inference works well
- Cases where explicit annotations are necessary

### Common Patterns

- Working with JSON data
- Type guards and type narrowing
- Variable initialization patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run TypeScript compiler: `tsc`
4. Execute the compiled JavaScript: `node dist/[filename].js`
